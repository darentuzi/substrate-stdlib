# Substrate-stdlib for Pallet Move

This repository is part of [Pallet Move](https://github.com/eigerco/pallet-move), which enables users to write smart contracts in Substrate-based blockchains with the Move language. This standard library can be included to provide elementary Substrate functions in Move smart contracts.

Currently, it contains the module:
- __balance__: Supports the transfer of balances on the blockchain and checking current balances on accounts. Find more details in the [module documentation](doc/balance.md).
- **substrate_hash**: Set of useful hash functions. Find more details in the [module documentation](doc/substrate_hash.md).
